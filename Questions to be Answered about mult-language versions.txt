can i develop for both wp8 and wp7 with same project in vs2012?
	you can upload 2 versions, one for 7 other for 8. users will automatically see the right one.

figure out how to change app title, depending on language
figure out how to change splashscreen, tile images, depending on language


options:
	keep current version in market, add new version supporting wp8 only.
		won't have to support 2 versions.
		

just make the new version support wp8.
