Notes:
If the application is not launched for 2 weeks, the Live Tile will stop updating. 
This is a Windows Phone OS restriction. 
You must re-launch, re-select your date from 'Days Since' and re-select the 'Show on Live Tile' checkbox again.


The Live Tile gets updated every half hour after power-up.  
So if the 'Days Since' count is off, wait half an hour for it to update correctly.
