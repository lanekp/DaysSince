step 1 prayer

Current:  "Dear Higher Power, my name is ____. I'm a real alcoholic... and I need your help today."

Perhaps s/b changed to use: (from pdf from aa-district26.org)
and from: http://friendsofbillw.net/twelve_step_prayers

Dear Lord, Help me to see and admit that I am powerless over my alcoholism.
Help me to understand how my alcoholism has led to unmanageability in my life.
Help me this day to understand the true meaning of powerlessness. Remove
from me all denial of my alcoholism. 
(This prayer is developed from the chapter, More About Alcoholism)


step 2 prayer:


Current:

Dear Higher Power, I'm standing at the turning point right now. 
Give me your protection and care as I abandon myself to you and give up my old ways and my old ideas just for today.

Perhaps s/b changed to use: (from pdf from aa-district26.org/pdf/Prayers/The%20Twelve%20Step%20Prayers%20from%20the%20Big%20Book%20of%20Alcoholics%20Anonymous.pdf)
and from:http://friendsofbillw.net/twelve_step_prayers

Heavenly Father, I am having trouble with personal relationships. I can't control
my emotional nature. I am prey to misery and depression. I can't make a living. I
feel useless. I am full of fear. I am unhappy. I can't seem to be of real help to
others. I know in my heart that only you can restore me to sanity if I am just
willing to stop doubting your power. I humbly ask that you help me to understand
that it is more powerful to believe than not to believe and that you are either
everything or nothing. (p. 52:2, 52:3, 53:1, 53:2)


step 3 prayer

Current:
Dear Higher Power, I offer myself to Thee to build with me and to do with me as Thou wilt. 
Relieve me of the bondage of self, that I may better do Thy will. 
Take away my difficulties, that victory over them may bear witness to those I would help of Thy Power, Thy Love, and Thy Way of life. 
May I do Thy will always.

and from:http://friendsofbillw.net/twelve_step_prayers


"God, I offer myself to thee - to build with me and do with me as Thou wilt. 
Relieve me of the bondage of self, that I may better do Thy will. 
Take away my difficulties, that victory over them may bear witness to those I would help of Thy Power, Thy Love and Thy Way of life. 
May I do Thy will always!" (63:2 original manuscript)  


step 4 prayer

Current:

Dear Higher Power, It is I who has made my life a mess. 
I have done it, but I cannot undo it. 
My mistakes are mine and I will begin a searching and fearless moral inventory. 
I will write down my wrongs but I will also include that which is good. 
I pray for the strength to complete the task.

there is a pre-inventory prayer, a 4th step resentment prayer and then anothe prayer: what to do?

A Pre-Inventory prayer:

"God, please help me to honestly take stock. Help me to search out the flaws in
my make-up which caused my failure. Help me to see where resentment has
plagued me and resulted in spiritual malady, but more importantly help me to
understand my part in these resentments. Help me to resolutely look for my own
mistakes and to understand where I had been selfish, dishonest, self-seeking
and frightened. Please help me to be searching and fearless in my endeavor to
write my inventory." (p. 64:2, 64:3, 67:2)


A 4th Step Resentment Prayer:
"God, Please help me to be free of anger and to see that the world and its people
have dominated me. Show me that the wrong-doing of others, fancied or real,
has the power to actually kill me. Help me to master my resentments by
understanding that the people who wrong me were perhaps spiritually sick.
Please help me show those I resent the same Tolerance, Pity and Patience that I
would cheerfully grant a sick friend.** Help me to see that this is a sick man.
Father, please show me how I can be helpful to him and save me from being
angry. Lord, help me to avoid retaliation or argument. I know I can't be helpful to
all people, but at least show me how to take a kindly and tolerant view of each
and every one. Thy will be done."(66:2, 66:3, 66:4, 67:0, 67:1)

Another prayer:

**Dear God, I have a resentment towards a person that I want to be free of. So, I
am asking you to give this person everything I want for myself. Help me to feel
compassionate understanding and love for this person. I pray that they will
receive everything they need. Thank you God for your help and strength with this
resentment. (BB, Freedom from Bondage: 552)


Step 5:

Current:

Dear Higher Power, My inventory has shown me who I am, 
Yet I ask for Your help in admitting my wrongs to another person and to You. 
Assure me, and be with me, in this step, for without this Step I cannot progress in my recovery. 
With Your help, I can do this, and I do it.




/****************************
Step 6:
Current:
Dear Higher Power, I am ready for Your help in removing from me the defects of character 
which I now realize are an obstacle to my recovery. 
Help me to continue being honest with myself and guide me toward spiritual and mental health.




/****************************
Step 7
Dear Higher Power, I am now willing that you should have all of me, good and bad. 
I pray that you now remove from me every single defect of character which 
stands in the way of my usefulness to you and my fellows. 
Grant me strength, as I go out from here to do your bidding.

Step 8

Dear Higher Power, I ask Your help in making my list of all those I have harmed. 
I will take responsibility for my mistakes and be forgiving to others as You are forgiving to me.

and "http://aa-district26.org/pdf/Prayers/The%20Twelve%20Step%20Prayers%20from%20the%20Big%20Book%20of%20Alcoholics%20Anonymous.pdf"

God, Please remove my Fears and show me your truth. 
Show me all the harms I have caused with my behavior and help me be willing 
to make amends to one and all. 
Help me to be willing to go to any lengths for victory over alcohol. (76:3) 


/****************************
Step 9

Dear Higher Power, I pray for the right attitude to make my amends, 
being ever mindful not to harm others in the process. 
I ask for Your guidance in making indirect amends. 
Most important, I will continue to make amends by staying abstinent, 
helping others and growing in spiritual progress.

and "http://aa-district26.org/pdf/Prayers/The%20Twelve%20Step%20Prayers%20from%20the%20Big%20Book%20of%20Alcoholics%20Anonymous.pdf"

God, with regard to this amend, give me the strength, courage and direction to
do the right thing, no matter what the personal consequences may be. Help me
not to shrink from anything. Help me not to delay if it can be avoided. Help me to
be sensible, tactful, considerate and humble without being servile or
scraping."(79:1, 83:3)


A 9th Step prayer for the Spouse:

"God, please show me how to make amends to my Spouse. Father , Help me to
keep my Spouse's happiness Uppermost in my mind as I try, with your Grace, to
make this relationship right. Amen" (82:1)

"God, please show me how to find the way of Patience, Tolerance, Kindness and
Love in my heart, my Mind and my Soul. Lord, show me how to demonstrate
these principles to my family and all those about me. Amen." (83:1)
